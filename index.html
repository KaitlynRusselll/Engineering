<p><u>This is my Week Two Blog</u>
    
</p><p>This week in class we spent a lot of time going over how to work AWS. With working on Aws, we learned all of the html commands that are needed to be able to push to this other website called github. On github, we will be able to see our websites come to life! We get a small preview already on AWS but to see it all on github is really very fascinating. I think that it is super amazing how we can add pictures and videos which gives our websites more dimension. I also got to really meet my table mates and make good connections with them.</p>




<p><u>This is my Week Three Blog:</u> 
</p><p>This week in class, we learned a lot of new things about this website called tinker cad. I learned that on tinker cad, I can create my designs in 3-d! Today in class, we did a challenge on tinker cad to see who could make the best design of an object from their home. For my design, I chose to do an Altoids can. For this altoids can, I attempted to draw my own design for the shape but when that had wonky edges, I used squares and half cylinders to fix wherever necessary. Below this paragraph, I'm going to add pictures of my work and the actual Altoid can that I drew inspiration from :p. We as well worked on our challenge project in which the goal is to use three Rube Goldberg designs to create something that will pop  balloon with a needle. For my design, I have choen to use the lever, the inclined plane, and the pulley. For this vision, I suggested that a pulley lower down something heavy on to the lever in order for the lever to toss the baseball up. After it is tossed, it will fall back down an roll down the inclined plane where it will hit a suspended needle that is hanging down from a cardboard stand in which after it is hit, will hit the balloon. Today, we are getting in groups to show all of our project ideas and we will decide who's will work best!</p>

<p><u>This is my Week Four Blog</u>
</p><p>This week in class, we finally got to agree upon in our groups which idea was the best for the project and get on with it. We started to build and with my group, things went relatively smoothly with starting to build Aaron's rendition of how the project should work. We started right on board with how to project was originally built and then strayed off to make some things work better and more accurately for the real life building. For example, we changed the shape of some of the bases for the machine from cylinders to rectangles. We even had disagreements in our group about whether or not we should have a platform, make rails, etc. All these arguments and trying and failing led to us finishing the project by Monday in class. I believe that we are ready to present, but we might fail the first time as I myself still have doubts about how straight the car will travel. We will see on Wednesday if the project will work!</p>
