    This week in class we spent a lot of time going over how to work AWS. With
    working on Aws, we learned all of the html commands that are needed to be
    able to push to this other website called github. On github, we will be able
    to see our websites come to life! We get a small preview already on AWS but
    to see it all on github is really very fascinating. I think that it is super
    amazing how we can add pictures and videos which gives our websites more
    dimension. I also got to really meet my table mates and make good
    connections with them.

    This week in class, we learned a lot of new things about this website called
    tinker cad. I learned that on tinker cad, I can create my designs in 3-d!
    Today in class, we did a challenge on tinker cad to see who could make the
    best design of an object from their home. For my design, I chose to do an
    Altoids can. For this altoids can, I attempted to draw my own design for the
    shape but when that had wonky edges, I used squares and half cylinders to
    fix wherever necessary. Below this paragraph, I'm going to add pictures of
    my work and the actual Altoid can that I drew inspiration from :p. We as
    well worked on our challenge project in which the goal is to use three Rube
    Goldberg designs to create something that will pop balloon with a needle.
    For my design, I have choen to use the lever, the inclined plane, and the
    pulley. For this vision, I suggested that a pulley lower down something
    heavy on to the lever in order for the lever to toss the baseball up. After
    it is tossed, it will fall back down an roll down the inclined plane where
    it will hit a suspended needle that is hanging down from a cardboard stand
    in which after it is hit, will hit the balloon. Today, we are getting in
    groups to show all of our project ideas and we will decide who's will work
    best!

    This week in class, we finally got to agree upon in our groups which idea
    was the best for the project and get on with it. We started to build and
    with my group, things went relatively smoothly with starting to build
    Aaron's rendition of how the project should work. We started right on board
    with how to project was originally built and then strayed off to make some
    things work better and more accurately for the real life building. For
    example, we changed the shape of some of the bases for the machine from
    cylinders to rectangles. We even had disagreements in our group about
    whether or not we should have a platform, make rails, etc. All these
    arguments and trying and failing led to us finishing the project by Monday
    in class. I believe that we are ready to present, but we might fail the
    first time as I myself still have doubts about how straight the car will
    travel. We will see on Wednesday if the project will work!

    In class this week, we were finally able to test our projects. This was
    super exciting for my group because we really thought we would get it on the
    first try. Sadly, when we walked into class on Monday, our project had been
    found slightly bent out of shape because someone in a previous class had
    stepped on it. On the bright side, it was an easy fix and we made it even
    better and more durable that same day. We were even able to test our project
    out and it worked! It took us four separate tries but we finally got it to
    work and it was very exciting. What we did to get it to work was tape the
    balloon down into place and also make a platform for our car to project
    itself off of when it was hit by the baseball. Below this paragraoh, there
    will be a video in which you can see our final attempt to hit and pop the
    balloon which worked!

    This week in class we started a new project. This project tasked me and my
    partner Greg to take apart a laptop and piece it back together. Now in this
    project, we struggled a lot with getting all of the parts out and then as
    well remembering where all of the screws went. We even sadly lost a shift
    key whilst trying to take out the keyboard. I sadly also did not make it to
    class on the second day of the project and Greg had to finish it himself in
    order to get the laptop put back together, but he told me everything that
    was done to put it back together an showed me the worksheet with all the
    parts of the laptop colored in. We as well had to color in an image of all
    of the parts in the computer and be able to identify them. This part was
    extremely easily (luckily) and I was able to feel like I could show where on
    the computer where each part was specifically.

    This week in class, we learned about bioengineering. Bioengineering puts
    together the components of biology and engineering, just as like it is
    implied in the name, and people in this field do many of things with
    anatomy. They make things such as prostethic limbs. These limbs, believe it
    or not, are made for not just people but animals as well. We were tasked
    with creating a prostethic limb for an animal in the wild of our choice and
    for my project I chose a penguin foot. For my foot, I made it out of titaium
    and as well plastic. These two parts would be able to hold up the weight of
    the penguin and as well withstand the 20 year lifespan of a typical penguin
    living in the arctic. Besides making our own prosthetics in tinkercad, we
    also learned about how bioengineers study the parts of animals that make
    thme great and useful to replicate for scientific purposes. For Example, we
    saw that some bioengineers recreated the feet and grips of geckos that allow
    them to climb tough surfaces to make a robotic gecko that would be able to
    climb the rough surfaces of Mars. I thought that this was extremely
    fascinating and that the idea was so unique and creative. Putting aside what
    we learned of bioengineering, we also did the Sandwhich challenge. For this
    challenge, we had to articulate instructures on how to make a pb&j sandwhich
    for another person to follow. This project showed how important being
    detailled and missing no steps is because in coding, if some instructions
    are missing, the code will not work and can easily be done wrong. Overall,
    this week was really enriching.

    This week in class, we learned about aerospace engineering. This field is
    something that I am particularly interested in and so I was very excited
    that this was the topic for the week. We learned about how the aerospace
    engineers created designs for things such as the ISS and even SpaceX
    projects to launch rockets into space. We watched a really cool video about
    the ISS and how the people who currently reside on it cut their hair. Along
    with our new knowledge of aerospace engineering, the class was now tasked
    with making a bottle rocket/plane that is meant to go as far as possible
    horizontally. This is different because normally bottle rockets are
    projected upwards so now there are a number of new questions that need to be
    asked about parachutes and how the rocket or plane will land smoothly. We as
    well for this project have to create a BOM which is essentially a list of
    materials describing how much you need of said item, what it is going to be
    used for, and a description of it. We finish this project next week but this
    week we were also tasked with creating a "flyng paper" that will fly from
    the second floor into or as close to a bin as possible for this weeks
    challenge. I made a paper airplane to the best of my ability but I sadly did
    not make it that far. Some people even just made paper balls and chucked
    them because that was not off limits and they did end up going pretty far.
    Overall, this week's highlight was learning about aerospace engineering and
    the ISS is a new interest of mine.

    This week in class, we worked on a bottle rocket project and launched it.
    With this bottle rocket, my group was Greg, Aaron and Yenah. We decided that
    Greg's design for the rocket was the best one because it seemed the most
    aerodynamic. For the rocket, we had used only one soda bottle and then
    cardboard for the fins as well as card stock for the nose cone. We used hot
    glue to put on and attach the fins and tape to attach the nose cone. We had
    thought initially that our rocket would have no issues but sadly when it was
    launched, it ended up just going in a small circle and then falling into the
    ground. We believe that it might have something to do with either the angle
    that it was launched, how much water was in it, or a design flaw with how
    our wings were put on. Overall, it was a really fun project that I enjoyed
    doing and I feel as if we could definitely fix the flaws and make the rocket
    go further if given a second chance.

    This week in class, we learned all about environmental engineering. With
    this knowledge, we did a project in which we were paired in random groups
    and were tasked with making a filter. In said filter, we got a bottle with
    holes in the bottom that we were supposed to fill with big rocks, small
    rocks, cotton, and sand. We decided that the best way to structure the
    bottle and pass water through it would be cotton on the bottom, sand above
    that, small rocks on top of that, and big rocks on the very top. This is
    because the big rocks would do the least filtration so they needed to be on
    top and the cotton was the one that would do the most filtration so we put
    that on the bottom right before the water would drain out. We decided to
    drain our water through twice and it came out the first time still
    relatively dirty but much better the second time around. If we were to do it
    a third or even fourth time, the water probably would have been even
    cleaner. As well, this week we did a fun halloween themed challenge with
    candy corn. For this challenge, we were given ten candy corn and a sheet of
    paper and we had to guess by doing some math how many candy corn it would
    take to fill up the page. For the math, my group placed as many candy corn
    sideways on the sheet as we could and then placed as many on the short side
    of the paper that we could to se how mnay rows we could fill going long ways
    and we ended up with 228 candy corn. We ended up winning the challenged
    because we got the closest number to the real number. Overall, I learned a
    lot about environmental engineering and I had a lot of fun with all of these
    projects.

    This week in class, we talked about business. We talked about business
    inorder to get a grasp on what it will be like in the real world when and if
    we go on to propose and sell our own engineering design. For this week, Ms.
    Petrosian went ahead and did a shark tank project where we all got in groups
    and proposed an engineered, original project to the class that everyone
    would critique. I unforunately did not participate in this project due to
    being absent on the first day that we started but from watching everyone
    present theirs, I learned that everyone in this class is so creative it's
    incredible. A lot of the inventions were silly, but a very cool thought!

    This week in class we discussed chemical engineering. With chemical
    engineering, there are many components and I believe that it was said it is
    also one of the highest paying sects of engineering. Chemical engineering
    can range from Nanotechnology to facial cleansers and even oil production.
    In order to get a better grasp on chemical engineering, we were given a
    challenge this week. The challenge was to think about a polluted lake and
    solve how to fix it. My group had selected a very wrong answer that would
    have taken much longer to solve the issue when the actual answer was to
    cover the lake in black shade balls to block the sun and therefore block the
    chemical reaction from taking place. As well, we also were givnen the fun
    challenge of making Ooobleck. This type of slime is made my mixing together
    a ratio of 1 cup water to 1.5 cups cornstarch in order to make a consistency
    that is hard when it is molded or hit at a fast pace but liquid when still.
    Me and my partner Caden achieved this and even dyed ours pink! I'll supply
    pictures below.

    For Weeks three through eight, we were tasked with creating a working
    arduino (coded) car or a civil engineering project. My project partner Caden
    and I picked a civil engineering project in which our goal was to regulate
    the traffic in the hallways and the stairwells of Crescenta Valley High
    School. In doing this, we were trying to accomplish getting people to not
    run into each other or cause other accidents that can be genuinely very
    dangerous. We have noticed that people will walk on opposite sides of the
    stairs and even run up them. This no good and we planned to fix this
    problem. I was unfortunately not here when the actual design was implemeted,
    but we planned on creating signs that were big and in your face unlike the
    small and easily unnoticeable arrows that were placed on the ground over
    qurantine.

    This week in class, there was a gutter boat made. This boat was made out of
    Balloons, a cup, popsicle sticks, rubber bands, straws, pipecleaner, safety
    pins and cardboard. The goal of this project was to create a gutter boat
    that would "walk" or motor itself forward with the popsicle stick
    propellers. The goal was to get the boat to take itself as far as possible.
    I was not there t document the boat, but I watched videos and a lot of those
    were able to go pretty far! It seemed like a really interesting project to
    be apart of.

    For this week, we had to start thinking about our egg dropp porject that we
    were tasked with in which we had to drop an egg off of the third floor
    without it breaking. This week, we had to make a preliminary sketch for the
    project and as well make a tinker cade. The sketch was pretty easy, but the
    tinker cad was slightly hard. I have never had good luck with building on
    tinker cad honestly, but I think this one may have turned out better than my
    previous ones lol. This week was pretty fun in general and I am very excited
    to actually drop the egg and see if it cracks because in our trial run with
    no egg, the box fell smoothly and landed on the bottom right where we wanted
    it to.
  </p>

  <p><u>This is my Week Eleven Blog</u></p>
  This week in class, we were tasked with what was called the egg drop project.
  For this project, we were only allowe cardboard, paper, cotton balls, straws,
  a bag, string, and one egg. We were tasked with making a contraption that
  would support the egg on its way off of the third floor. When the egg hit the
  ground inside of whatever it was that was made, the egg would not break. What
  my partners Caden, Yenah, Ashley, and I decided to do was to make a tiny 4
  inch by 4 inch box that would be filled with twenty cotton balls and two
  pieces of paper surrounding the egg and on the corners of that box, coonnect
  string about four inches to a parachute made from one tiny trashbag. Our
  parachute box worked! The egg did not break when it was thrown down which is
  very exciting.

    This week in class we were given a new project, we need to create a
    cardboard boat that can hold two people and go from one end of the crescenta
    valley high school swimming pool to the other and right back again. We are
    only given cardboard and tape for this which makes the prospect kind of
    scary but I have full confidence that my group consisting of Caden, Yenah,
    Ashley, and I can do it! We have so far made the tinker cad for the boat and
    decided on a design that we researched deeply and believe will work. We have
    decided as well that Yenah and Ashley will be the ones inside of the boat
    paddling back and forth because they are the smallest so its less weight for
    the boat to carry. I am very excited and nervous to see how well our design
    will hold up.
  </p>
  
  <p><u>This is my Week Thirteen Blog</u>
  </p><p>This week in class we started building our cardboard boat project! It was really exciting to be given the chance to start this and we don't have tape yet so we just started cutting out the pieces of the cardboard that we need for the boat. We had decided for the shape that we wish to have is a long rectangle with a triangle point at the top that will be bent slightly up. We had researched that the more surface area that there is, the better the floatation will be. We have gotten all of the pieces cut out so far and even made a mini boat! I will put a video of the mini boat in but we have decided that we need to tweak it due to the fact that it sunk when we added weight to it. Now, we wait for tape and hope to try our design soon!</p>

<p><u>This is my Week Fourteen Blog</u>
</p><p>This week in class, we built up more of our cardboard boat! It was really fun for all of us to get together and continue cutting up the cardboard and having fun with it too. I was in Canada for the last two class periods of the week, but I had a really great time when I was there. I feel like right now with how our building is going, the boat will stay up and it will float but I don't want to get too optimistic until our prototype works in the water. I want to build another prototype that floats and maybe during this we will find another way to work our big boat. For example, we were thinking we could add a piece that extends out for stabilization. Overall, things are going pretty smooth.</p>

<p><u>This is my Week Fifteen Blog</u>
</p>This week in class, we continued once again making more of our boat. We were able to get a lot done in regards to putting things together and making it look good! So far, it is really looking like a promising boat. Taking a look around at the other boats, I think ours was the perfect size and looks really good to fit me and Ashley and as well our walls are high enough to keep the water out but also be able to paddle.</p>

<p><u>This is my Week Sixteen Blog</u>
</p><p>This week for class we had spent our time making the final touches on our boat. For the most part, I really believe that our boat will float successfully! Myself and Ashley are a little nervous to add our weight to it when it comes time t actually go on the boat but it should hold steady. We rationed our tape properly and everything is looking really promising!</p>

<p><u>This is my Week Seventeen Blog</u>
</p><p>This week in class we really got to decorate our boat and make the finishing touches. We added drawings all over the boat and my group had a super fun time drawing together. Caden even made a cardboard hat as a little exta! We have a penguin on the boat, stitch, and even put all of our names in print and cursive. Lastly, we made a flag and it looks really epic!</p>
